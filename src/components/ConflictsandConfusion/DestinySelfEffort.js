            Wherever there are human beings - in India as well as all over the
            world-there exists the 'varna vyavastha". Mistakenly called the
            'caste system, it has created misunderstandings and negative
            connotations. Here, we will try and understand this universal system
            in more detail and with an open mind.

            The word 'varna' means to describe. One describes an object by its
            qualities. Varna also means colour, hence the literal translation of
            varna vyavastha is Colour System. Colour obviously does not mean the
            colour of the skin. Human beings are categorized into four types
            (varnas) on the basis of their qualities (gunas) and professions
            (karmas). This fourfold categorisation in India is called the Varna
            System.

            <b>The Four Types of Human Beings</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            The fourfold categorisation of human beings on the basis of
            qualities (gunas) is as below:
            <br />
            1. Brahmin: Predominantly sattva (approx. 70%) backed by rajas
            (approx. 20%) and tamas (approx.10%).
            <br /> 2. Ksatriya: Predominantly rajas (approx. 70%)backed by
            sattva (approx. 20%) and tamas (approx. 10%). <br />
            3. Vaisya: Predominantly rajas (approx. 70%) backed by tamas
            (approx. 20%) and sattva (approx.10%). <br />
            4. Südra: Predominantly tamas (approx. 70%) backed by rajas (approx.
            20%) and sattva (approx.10%).
          </p>

          <p>
            It should, of course, be understood that the proportions are
            approximate and not to be taken literally. They vary in different
            people but what is noteworthy is that all of us have each of the
            three qualities. No human being, however good or bad, can claim to
            have only one or two of the three. Also the proportion of these
            gunas may vary in us at different times and stages in life. It is
            possible that a lethargic and laid-back person may, at a time in
            life, become dynamic and a go-getter. Ratnakara, a dacoit did become
            the famous composer of the Rāmāyaṇa, Sage Valmiki. Such drastic
            changes are however not frequent.

            <b>Four Types of Professions</b>
            <br />
            <br />
            The three qualities prompt the four types of human beings into
            different professions:
            <br />
            1. Brahmins: Being knowledge and peace oriented, they become
            teachers, researchers, priests, advisors, visionaries, artists and
            so on. <br />
            2. Ksatriya: Since they are action oriented and backed by noble
            intentions they become rulers, leaders, social workers, patrons of
            fine arts and so on.
            <br /> 3. Vaisya: Even though they are action oriented like the
            kñatriyas, they are backed by profit motive and with an ability to
            mobilise and create wealth and resources. They, therefore, become
            traders, farmers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, moneylenders and so
            on. <br />
            4. Sudras: Not being inclined towards knowledge or action, they are
            not self-motivated. They become good labourers, helpers, artisans,
            craftsmen, farmhands and so on.

            When people take to professions (karmas) according to their
            qualities (gunas) it is like fish taking to water. They have natural
            inclination towards their jobs and so love what they do. Hence, they
            grow, prosper and become happy. If however, the gunas and karmas do
            not complement each other, there is a lot of hypocrisy, tension and
            frustration within, confusion and chaos in the field of action and
            suffering for all.

            A businessman who lawfully makes huge profitsis admired, respected
            and awarded. On the other hand, a politician who works only for huge
            profits is condemned and disrespected. Mahatma Gandhi had a mass
            following, was feared by the British and is admired by the world,
            even though he had no money, power, arms or ammunition.
