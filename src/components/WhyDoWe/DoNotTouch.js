            In Indian homes, we are taught from a very young age never to touch
            papers, books and people with our feet. If the feet accidentally
            touch papers, books, musical instruments or any other educational
            equipments, children are told to reverentially touch what was
            stamped, with their hands and then touch their eyes as a mark of
            apology.

            To Indians, knowledge is sacred and divine. So it must be given
            respect at all times. Nowadays we separate subjects as sacred and
            secular. But in ancient India every subject - academic or spiritual
            - was considered divine and taught by the Guru in the gurukula.

            The custom of not stepping on educational tools, is a frequent
            reminder of the high position accorded to knowledge in Indian
            culture. Thus knowledge, a knowledgeable person, learning materials,
            the source of knowledge and the deity of knowledge, all are
            considered worshipful. From an early age, this wisdom fosters in us
            a deep reverence for books and education. This is also the reason
            why we worship books, vehicles and instruments once a year on
            Sarasvati Pūjā or Ayudha Puja day, dedicated to the Goddess. of
            learning. So, each day before starting our studies, we pray

            Children are also strongly discouraged from touching people with
            their feet. Even if this happens accidentally, we touch the person
            and bring the fingers to our eyes as a mark of apology. Even when
            elders touch a younger person inadvertently with their feet, they
            immediately apologise.

            To touch another with the feet is considered an act of misdemeanor.

            Man is regarded as the most beautiful, living, breathing temple of
            the Lord. Therefore, touching another with the feet is akin to
            disrespecting the divinity within him or her. This calls for an
            immediate apology, which is offered with reverence and humility.

            Thus, many of our customs are designed to be simple but powerful
            reminders or pointers of profound philosophical truths. This is one
            of the factors that has kept Indian culture alive across centuries.
