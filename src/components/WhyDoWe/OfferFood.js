            Western tradition food is partaken after a thanksgiving prayer -
            grace. Indians make an offering of it to the Lord, and later partake
            of it as prasada - a holy gift from the Lord. In temples and in many
            homes, the cooked food is first offered to the Lord, each day. The
            offered food is mixed with the rest of the food and then served as
            prasada. In our daily ritualistic worship (pūjā) too, we offer
            <b> naivedyam</b> (food) to the Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lord is omnipotent and omniscient. All that we do is by His
            strength and knowledge alone. Being the Totality, all that we
            receive in life as a result of our actions is really His alone. We
            acknowledge this through the act of offering food to Him. This is
            exemplified by the famous ärati words in Hindi - terä tujhako arpana
            - 'I offer what is Yours to You'. Thereafter, what is received is
            His gift to us (prasada), graced by His divine touch. tube

            Knowing this, our entire attitude to food and the act of eating
            changes. The food offered is pure and the best and shared with
            others, before consuming. We do not demand, complain or criticise
            the quality of the food we get. We do not waste or reject it. We eat
            it with a cheerful acceptance (prasada buddhi). When we become
            established in this attitude, we are then able to cheerfully accept
            all we get in life, as His prasada.

            Before we partake of our daily meals, we first sprinkle water around
            the plate as an act of purification. Five morsels of food are placed
            on the side of the plate acknowledging the debt owed by us to a)
            divine forces (devată ṛṇa) - for their benign grace and protection,
            b) our ancestors (pitr rna) - for giving us their lineage and a
            family culture, c) the sages (rsi rna) - as our religion and culture
            have been 'realised', maintained and handed down to us by them. d)
            our fellow beings (manusya ma) - who constitute the society, without
            the support of which we could not live as we do, e) other living
            beings (bhūta rna) - for serving us selflessly.

            Thereafter, the Lord, the Life Force, who is also within us as the
            five life-giving physiological functions, is offered the food. This
            is done with the chant - Om präṇāya svähä, Om apanaya svähä, Om
            vyǎnǎya svähä, Om udānāya svähä, Om samānāya svähä, Om brahmane
            svāhā [referring to the five physiological functions respiratory
            (prāna), excretory (apāna), circulatory (vyāna), digestive (samana)
            and reversal (udāna) systems]. After offering the food thus, it is
            eaten as prasada - blessed food. <br />
            To remember this concept, many chant following verses of the Gita -

            Brahman is the oblation; the clarified butter; the fire; the
            oblation... Brahman (the Supreme) shall be reached by him, who sees
            the Supreme in all actions. Residing in all living beings as the
            digestive fire, I digest the four types of food eaten by them (as an
            offering to Me).
