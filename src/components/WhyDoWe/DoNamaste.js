                <div><p>Indians greet each other with <b>'namaste'</b>. The two palms are placed together in front of the chest and the head bows whilst saying the word 'namaste'. This greeting is for all - people younger or older than us, of our own age, for friends and even for strangers.</p>
                    <p>There are five forms of formal traditional greetings enjoined in the scriptures of which namaskara is one of them. Besides greeting, this gesture is also used for praying and offering homage to God.</p></div>

                    <p>Namaste could be just a casual or formal greeting, a cultural convention or an act of worship. However, there is much more to it than meets the eye. In Sanskrit namaḥ + te = namaste. It means - I bow to you - my greetings, salutations or prostration to you. Namah can also be interpreted as 'na mama' (not mine). It has a spiritual
                        significance of negating or reducing one's ego and possessiveness in the presence of another.
                    </p>

                    <p>The real meeting between people is the meeting of their minds. When we greet another, we do so with namaste, which means, 'may our minds meet', indicated by the folded palms placed before the chest. The bowing down of the head is a gracious form of extending friendship in love and humility.</p></div>

                    <p>The spiritual meaning is even deeper. The Life Force, the Divine, the Self or the Lord in me is the same in all. Recognising this oneness with the meeting of the palms, we salute with head bowed to the Divine in the person we meet. That is why sometimes, we close our eyes as we do namaste to a revered person or the Lord - as if to look at the Self within. The gesture is often accompanied by words like<b> 'Rama Rama', 'Jai Śri Kṛṣṇa', 'Namo Nārāyaṇa', 'Jai Siya Rama', 'Om Santi'</b> and so on, indicating the recognition of this</p>
                    <p>When we know this significance, our greeting does not remain just a superficial gesture or word but paves the way for a deeper communion with another, in an atmosphere of love and respect.
